# Contributing Guide
Ahoy! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è You made it to the Runrig community! üöú

If you're reading this, we haven't set up a dedicated contributing guide for
this project. This guide is from our GitHub [Community Health Files]. In
general, we welcome contributions but are a small group so don't have a lot of
protocols in place.

If you have a specific bug to report that effects this project, please do open
an issue and we'll follow up as soon as we can. For general inquiries and
information, you can join the chat in our Matrix channel,
[#runrig-coop:matrix.org], or open a new topic from the [Discussions] tab if
we've set one up for this repository. or join one of our open community events 

Checkout our website for more ways to [get involved].
